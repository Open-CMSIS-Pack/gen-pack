# Contributing to gen-pack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **gen-pack** in the Open-CMSIS-Pack organisation!  
This project is licensed under Apache 2.0.  
Before you begin, please review the following guidelines.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report an issue**: If you find a bug, unexpected behaviour or have a suggestion for improvement, please open an issue first so we can discuss it together.  
- **Open a pull request (PR)**: Fix bugs, add new features, improve documentation, add tests or examples.

## Issue guidelines

When you create an issue, please use one of the labels (if applicable):  

- `bug` – a defect or incorrect behaviour  
- `enhancement` – a new feature proposal or improvement  
- `documentation` – missing or unclear documentation  
- `question` – seeking further clarification  
Try to avoid duplicates (check existing issues and closed issues first).

## Pull request process

1. Fork the repository and create your feature branch (e.g. `my-feature`).  
2. Ensure you build and test locally (see DEVELOPMENT.md).  
3. Make your changes in a clear, focused way (smaller PRs are preferred).  
4. Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)).  
5. Push your branch to your fork and open a PR toward `main`.  
6. Describe in the PR what you changed and why; link to the related issue if applicable.  
7. We perform the review; maintainers may request changes or improvements.  
8. Once approved and merged, your contribution will become part of the project.

## Style & quality guidelines

- Maintain consistency with existing code style (Bash scripts, tree structure, naming).  
- Add or update tests if applicable (see `test/` folder).  
- Documentation updates are welcome (e.g., in `template/` or README.md).  
- Always remove trailing whitespace, ensure Unix line endings, and follow POSIX/Bash conventions.

## Getting help

If you'd like to ask for help or propose a large change, you may open an issue and tag it as `discussion`.  
You can also ask on the maintainers’ communication channel (as listed in the README) if available.

Thank you for helping us make this project better!
